### What is stock control data?

Stock control data is information collected from hospital pharmacy systems that is used to track and manage medicines use within hospitals. These systems support management of inventory levels, monitoring of medication usage and tracking of costs. 

Unlike primary care prescribing data, hospital stock control data is not based on individual patient prescriptions. The data represents medication distribution within hospitals, such as issuing of medicines to wards or clinical areas, rather than actual patient-level prescribing. 

### Which medicines and devices are included?

All medicines and devices used by NHS Trusts in England with a dm+d code are included.

### Why can't I find the medicine I am looking for?

There are several possible reasons:

* You're searching for a brand name which are not available in the SCMD. Search for generic names of the medicine you're looking for.
* It might not be issued in hospitals. Some medicines are only used in primary care.
* It might not have been prescribed within the NHS before.
* What you're looking for is a non-standardised item - where specific medicines do not have a dm+d code, they cannot be standardised across organisations and are not included within the SCMD. Examples include clean room consumables and packaging items.
* The medicine is dispensed by community pharmacy. NHS prescriptions supplied by hospitals but dispensed in community pharmacy are not included in the SCMD, but this data is available separately. This may be incorporated into the OpenPrescribing Hospitals platform in the future.

### Which NHS Trusts are included?

The platform includes data from all NHS hospital trusts in England that submit data to Rx-Info. This includes all NHS Acute, Teaching, Specialist, Mental Health and Community Trusts in England (this does not include medications dispensed by community pharmacy but this is [available separately](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/hospital-prescribing-dispensed-in-the-community)).

### Why can't I find my hospital on the platform?

There are multiple reasons your hospital may not be present in the data presented. These include:

* **Data is reported at the level of individual NHS Trusts**. NHS Trusts can be made up of multiple sites. If you can't find your hospital, try searching for it by its NHS Trust name.
* **NHS Trusts sometimes undergo organisational change, such as mergers or acquisitions**. The hospital you are looking for could be included in the dataset under a different name to what you might expect. Data for NHS Trusts which are now part of another NHS Trust is aggregated into the successor organisation. You can find all NHS Trusts historically included in the SCMD, with an indication of their current NHS Trust on the [Submission History page](https://hospitals.openprescribing.net/submission-history/).
