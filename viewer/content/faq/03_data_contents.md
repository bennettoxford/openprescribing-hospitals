### What is stock control data?

Stock control data is information collected from hospital pharmacy systems that is used to track and manage medicines use within hospitals. These systems support management of inventory levels, monitoring of medication usage and tracking of costs. 

Unlike primary care prescribing data, hospital stock control data is not based solely on individual patient prescriptions. Instead, it reflects how medications are distributed within hospitals. This can include medications supplied directly to patients – for example, upon discharge or via outpatient pharmacies – but also includes medications distributed to wards and clinical areas. Since not all medications issued from the stocks are ultimately administered, the data does not specifically detail the actual number of patients receiving the medication.

### Which medicines and devices are included?

All medicines and devices used by NHS Trusts in England with a dm+d code are included.

### Which NHS Trusts are included?

The platform includes data from all NHS hospital trusts in England that submit data to Rx-Info. This includes all NHS Acute, Teaching, Specialist, Mental Health and Community Trusts in England (this does not include medications dispensed by community pharmacy but this is [available separately](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/hospital-prescribing-dispensed-in-the-community)).

### Why can't I find my hospital on the platform?

There are multiple reasons your hospital may not be present in the data presented. These include:

* **Data is reported at the level of individual NHS Trusts**. NHS Trusts can be made up of multiple sites. If you can’t find your hospital, try searching for it by it’s NHS Trust name.
* **NHS Trusts sometimes undergo organisational change, such as mergers or acquisitions**. The hospital you are looking for could be included in the dataset under a different name to what you might expect. Data for NHS Trusts which are now part of another NHS Trust is aggregated into the successor organisation. You can find all NHS Trusts historically included in the SCMD, with an indication of their current NHS Trust on the [Submission History page](https://hospitals.openprescribing.net/submission-history/).
