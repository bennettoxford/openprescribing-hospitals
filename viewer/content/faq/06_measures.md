### How are measures calculated?

Measures can simply be a count of the amount of a drug being issued but more commonly a ratio is used. To calculate a ratio, we specify a list of products to include in the denominator and the subset of these products which make up the numerator. We then sum the quantity issued across the numerator and denominator separately, divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

### What are percentile charts?

Percentile charts show the extent of variation in medication use at the level of individual trusts. You can read more about why we use them in our blogs, [communicating variation in prescribing](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2019/04/communicating-variation-in-prescribing-why-we-use-deciles/) and [highlighting variation in hospitals medicines usage](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2025/04/highlighting-variation-in-hospitals-medicines-usage).

### Why do some trusts have out of range values?

Within the SCMD, it is possible for issued quantity to be negative (see [Why are there negative values for some products?](faq/#why-are-there-negative-values-for-some-products)). When calculting measures with both a numerator and denominator, values are expected to be between 0% and 100%. However, negative values can result in the numerator being greater than the denominator (so the measure value can be greater than 100%) or the denominator being negative (so the measure value can be less than 0%).
