### What does beta mean?

The platform is currently in beta, which means it's made available early to allow us to gather feedback and improve the platform. This also allows you to get an early look at the platform and helps us build a community of users to drive the development of the platform.

This does mean that you may encounter occasional issues or features that are still being refined. Please [let us know if you encounter any issues or have any feedback](contact/).

### How can I keep up to date with the platform?

You can [sign up for email alerts](/alerts/) to receive updates about the platform, including new data releases and feature announcements. See the [Contact page](contact/) for other ways to stay in touch.
