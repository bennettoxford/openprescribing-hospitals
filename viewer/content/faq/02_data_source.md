### Where do you get the data from?

The primary data source for the OpenPrescribing Hospitals platform is the [Secondary Care Medicines Dataset (SCMD)](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/secondary-care-medicines-data-indicative-price). The SCMD is collated by [Rx-info](https://www.rx-info.co.uk/) and hosted on the [National Health Service Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) Open Data Portal](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/secondary-care-medicines-data-indicative-price). 

There is detailed user guide provided on the NHSBSA Open Data Portal alongside the data but briefly the SCMD contains processed pharmacy stock control data. Data is collected and curated from individual trusts by Rx-info. Rx-info then shares the data with the NHSBSA who make it openly available. 

Other data sources which are linked to the SCMD to provide supplementary detail on the products and organisations within the SCMD, are described on the [About page](about/#data-sources).

### How often is it updated?

The SCMD is published monthly by the NHSBSA. Data is published with a 1 month delay, allowing for aggregation and curation of the dataset by Rx-Info prior to publication.
The [date of each release is available via the NHSBSA](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/data-release-calendar). This data is made available on the OpenPrescribing Hospitals platform shortly after publication by the NHSBSA.

New data is initially made available as provisional data (see [What is provisional data?](faq/#what-is-provisional-data)). You can check the status of data available for analysis on OpenPrescribing Hospitals using our [Submission History](submission-history/) page. 


### What is provisional data?

Monthly data within the SCMD is initially published as provisional data. Provisional data is subject to change as Trusts submitting to the SCMD can update historical issues to reflect actual use. This is known as backtracking and affects 45% of the NHS Trusts submitting data to the SCMD. Backtracking is at its greatest in the most recent 3 months of data.  Two months after the close of the financial year - once backtracking is accounted for - data is published as finalised data. 

To see the data available or to read more about how it is made available please refer to the [NHSBSA Open Data Portal](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/secondary-care-medicines-data-indicative-price) where the SCMD is hosted. Alternatively we provide a summary of the latest data availability on our [Submission History page](https://hospitals.openprescribing.net/submission-history/).
