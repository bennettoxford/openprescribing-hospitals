### Why is data missing for my Trust?

The SCMD dataset relies on submission of pharmacy stock control data by individual NHS Trusts. For some NHS Trusts, submissions are not available for some months or submissions are incomplete. The data completeness for individual NHS Trusts can be found on the [Submission History](https://hospitals.openprescribing.net/submission-history/) page.
