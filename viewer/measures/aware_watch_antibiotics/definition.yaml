description: Percentage of antibiotic DDDs that are classified as "Watch" or "Reserve" antibiotics according to the WHO AWaRe classification system
why_it_matters: |
    The WHO AWaRe classification categorises antibiotics into Access, Watch, and Reserve groups to guide appropriate antibiotic selection and promote antimicrobial stewardship. "Watch" antibiotics are second-choice treatments that should be used with caution due to their higher resistance potential, whilst "Reserve" antibiotics are last-resort treatments that should be preserved for critical situations. Monitoring the proportion of Watch and Reserve antibiotics helps identify opportunities to optimise antibiotic prescribing by promoting first-line "Access" antibiotics where clinically appropriate, and ensures that higher-risk antibiotics are used judiciously.
how_is_it_calculated: >
    The numerator includes all DDDs of antibiotics classified as "Watch" or "Reserve" in the WHO AWaRe 2024 list. 
    The denominator includes all DDDs of antibiotics classified as "Access", "Watch", or "Reserve" in the WHO AWaRe 2024 list.
    This creates a percentage showing the proportion of higher-concern antibiotics (Watch and Reserve) relative to all classified antibiotics used.
