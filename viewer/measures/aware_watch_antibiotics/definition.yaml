description: Percentage of antibiotic DDDs that are classified as "Watch" or "Reserve" antibiotics according to the UK-AWaRe classification
why_it_matters: |
    The [UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aware-antibiotic-classification/uk-access-watch-reserve-and-other-classification-for-antibiotics-uk-aware-antibiotic-classification) has adapted the [World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) AWaRe classification](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MHP-HPS-EML-2023.04) to develop the [UK-AWaRe antibiotic classification](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aware-antibiotic-classification/uk-access-watch-reserve-and-other-classification-for-antibiotics-uk-aware-antibiotic-classification), taking into account antibiotic resistance profiles, antibiotic prescribing and stewardship practice in the UK. The classification groups antibiotics into four categories: Access, Watch, Reserve and Other, to support appropriate prescribing and promote effective antimicrobial stewardship.  
    - **Access antibiotics** are generally narrow-spectrum and associated with a lower risk of resistance. They are recommended as first or second choice options for common infections and should be readily available.  
    - **Watch antibiotics** are broader-spectrum with a higher resistance potential. Their use should be limited to specific indications and monitored closely.  
    - **Reserve antibiotics** are last-line treatments, often reserved for severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. These medicines require strict oversight to maintain their effectiveness.  
    Monitoring the use of Watch and Reserve antibiotics can help identify areas to improve prescribing, encouraging the appropriate use of Access antibiotics where clinically suitable, and ensuring that higher-risk antibiotics are used only when necessary.
how_is_it_calculated: >
    The numerator includes all DDDs of antibiotics classified as "Watch" or "Reserve" in the [UK-AWaRe list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aware-antibiotic-classification/uk-access-watch-reserve-and-other-classification-for-antibiotics-uk-aware-antibiotic-classification).  
    The denominator includes all DDDs of antibiotics classified as "Access", "Watch", or "Reserve" in the [UK-AWaRe list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aware-antibiotic-classification/uk-access-watch-reserve-and-other-classification-for-antibiotics-uk-aware-antibiotic-classification).  
    This creates a percentage showing the proportion of higher-concern antibiotics (Watch and Reserve) relative to all classified antibiotics used.
