why_it_matters: |
    NHS faces significant operational and productivity challenges. Licensed ready-to-administer products offer a 
    practical means of reducing cognitive load, simplifying workflows and releasing clinical capacity. They are 
    also safer, less chance of error or contamination. [Lord Carter’s Transforming NHS Pharmacy Aseptic Services 
    in England review](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5f9afdbdd3bf7f1e405d9a23/aseptic-pharmacy.pdf), 
    the uptake of licensed ready-to-administer injectable products remains limited. This is 
    despite clear recommendations and reported benefits for patient safety and workforce efficiency.
how_is_it_calculated: |
    We divide the number of [unit doses](/faq/#unit-dose) of injectable adrenaline (1 in 10,000) issued as ampoules by the total number of 
    unit doses of injectable adrenaline (1 in 10,000) issued. We then multiply that by 100 to obtain the % each month.
