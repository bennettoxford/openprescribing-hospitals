name: Percentage of paracetamol issued as intravenous formulation
short_name: IV paracetamol
description: |
  The percentage of paracetamol intravenous formulation of all paracetamol issued.

why_it_matters: |
  Intravenous paracetamol is significantly more expensive than oral or rectal formulations and has a higher carbon footprint. [NHS Scotland guidance](https://www.nhscfsd.co.uk/media/ohqpgog3/ngtp-paracetamol-iv-to-oral-v20-aug-23.pdf), informed by available evidence, supports switching suitable patients from intravenous to oral paracetamol as a safe and effective intervention. Reducing unnecessary use of intravenous paracetamol can lead to substantial cost and carbon savings.

how_is_it_calculated: >
  We divide the number of [Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)](/faq/#what-is-a-defined-daily-dose-ddd) of intravenous paracetamol products by the total number of DDDs of all paracetamol products and then multiply by 100 to obtain a percentage each month.
