why_it_matters: |
    Overdose of methotrexate for non-cancer treatment was described as an [NHS Never Event in 2018](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2018-Never-Events-List-updated-February-2021.pdf). To reduce the risk of harm, the British National Formulary (BNF) states that methotrexate should, usually, only be prescribed and dispensed as a single strength of tablet, usually 2.5 mg, to reduce the risk of harm from errors.
how_is_it_calculated: >
    We divide the number of methotrexate 10mg tablets by the total number of methotrexate tablets and then multiply that by 100 to obtain the % each month.
