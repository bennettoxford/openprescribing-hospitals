    NHS faces significant operational and productivity challenges.Licensed ready-to-administer products offer a practical means of reducing cognitive load, simplifying workflows and releasing clinical capacityThey are also safer, less chance of error or contamination. Lord Carter’s Transforming NHS Pharmacy Aseptic Services in England review, the uptake of licensed ready-to-administer injectable products remains limited. This is despite clear recommendations and reported benefits for patient safety and workforce efficiency[Nivolumab](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support/treatments-and-drugs/nivolumab) can be used in the treatment of a range of common cancers. If given intravenously the infusions can take 30-60 minutes. This uses a lot of nursing time and most importantly the patients time. In April 2025 a new formulation of nivolumab designed to be administered as a subcutaneous injection in a fraction of the time received approval for use in the UK. NHS England [announced](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/04/nhs-rolls-out-5-minute-super-jab-for-15-cancers/) in April 2025 that it would be supporting the introduction of subcutaneous nivolumab. Although not all patients will be eligible, around two in five of those currently receiving intravenous nivolumab are expected to switch to the new subcutaneous injection and most eligible new patients are also expected to begin on the injectable form of nivolumab.

how_is_it_calculated: |
    We divide the number of unit doses of injectable ephderine issued as ampoules by the total number of 
    unit doses of injectable ephderine issued. We then multiply that by 100 to obtain the % each month.
