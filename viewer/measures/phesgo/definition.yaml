why_it_matters: |
    Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are used to treat breast cancer. If given separately, they are administered via two intravenous infusions which can take up to two and a half hours. This uses a lot of nursing time and most importantly the patients time. [Phesgo](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support/treatments-and-drugs/trastuzumab-and-pertuzumab) is a combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab and is administered as a subcutaneous injection, in a fraction of the time. Phesgo was made available in 2021 and was [highlighted by NHSE as a medicines optimisation opportunity to improve equitable adoption of the most clinically and cost-effective medicines](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/national-medicines-optimisation-opportunities-2023-24/#3-improving-uptake-of-the-most-clinically-and-cost-effective-medicines).

how_is_it_calculated: |
    We divide the number of products containing trastuzumab and pertuzumab (Phesgo) by the total number of products containing pertuzumab including Phesgo. We then multiply that by 100 to obtain the % each month.
