why_it_matters: |
    NHS faces significant operational and productivity challenges. Licensed ready-to-administer products offer a 
    practical means of reducing cognitive load, simplifying workflows and releasing clinical capacity. They are 
    also safer, less chance of error or contamination. [Lord Carter’s Transforming NHS Pharmacy Aseptic Services 
    in England review](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5f9afdbdd3bf7f1e405d9a23/aseptic-pharmacy.pdf), 
    the uptake of licensed ready-to-administer injectable products remains limited. This is 
    despite clear recommendations and reported benefits for patient safety and workforce efficiency.
how_is_it_calculated: |
    We divide the number of [unit doses](/faq/#unit-dose) of injectable atropine issued as ampoules by the total number of 
    unit doses of injectable atropine issued. We then multiply that by 100 to obtain the % each month.
