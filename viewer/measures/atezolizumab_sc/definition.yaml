why_it_matters: |
    [Atezolizumab](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support/treatments-and-drugs/atezolizumab) can be used in the treatment of a range of common cancers. If given intravenously the infusions can take 30-60 minutes. This uses a lot of nursing time and most importantly the patients time. In August 2023 a new formulation of atezolizumab designed to be administered as a subcutaneous injection in a fraction of the time received approval for use in the UK. NHS England [announced](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2023/08/nhs-world-first-rollout-of-cancer-jab-that-cuts-treatment-time-by-up-to-75/) in August 2023 that it would be supporting the introduction of subcutaneous atezolizumab.  Although the [majority of patients starting treatment with atezolizumab are expected to switch to the new subcutaneous injection](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2023/08/nhs-world-first-rollout-of-cancer-jab-that-cuts-treatment-time-by-up-to-75/), there may be a small number who remain on the intravenous infusion.
how_is_it_calculated: |
    We divide the number of products issued of the atezolizumab subcutaneous formulation by the total number of products issued of atezolizumab. We then multiply that by 100 to obtain the % each month.
