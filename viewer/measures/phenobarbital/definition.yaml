    The proportion of liquid phenobarbital products issued as alcohol-containing preparations.
why_it_matters: |
    The RCPCH and NPPG position statement [Choosing an Oral Liquid Medicine for Children](https://nppg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Position-Statement-Liquid-Choice-V1a.pdf)
    states that recommended practice in the UK is to use an ethanol-free unlicensed 50 mg/5 mL liquid for the oral administration of phenobarbital to children when an oral liquid 
    is required. Phenobarbital Elixir BP (15 mg/5 mL) contains 38% v/v of ethanol (alcohol), and so there is potential for accumulation when ingested repeatedly, especially in 
    young children with low or immature metabolic capacity.
how_is_it_calculated: >
    We select all phenobarbital or phenobarbital sodium products prepared as a solution or suspension.  The quantity of each product issued as DDDs is calculated.
    We then divide the DDDs of `Phenobarbital 15mg/5ml elixir` by the total DDDs of all selected phenobarbital products and then multiply that by 100 to 
    obtain a percentage each month.
