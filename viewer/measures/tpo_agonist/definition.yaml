how_is_it_calculated: >
    We identify all TPO agonist products using Virtual Therapeutic Moieties (VTM) codes. The quantity of each product issued as DDDs is calculated. We then divide the
    DDDs of TPO agonists excluding eltrombopag by the total DDDs of all TPO agonists and then multiply that by 100 to obtain a percentage each month.
