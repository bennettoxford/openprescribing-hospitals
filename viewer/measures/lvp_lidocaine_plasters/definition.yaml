    [NHS England guidance](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/items-which-should-not-routinely-be-prescribed-in-primary-care-policy-guidance/) identifies a number of items which provide low value when prescribed. This guidance has mainly been aimed at primary care but we think it is important to also monitor a selection of these in hospitals - read more about why [in our blog](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2025/04/low-value-medicines-in-openprescribing-hospitals/).

    [NHS England guidance](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/items-which-should-not-routinely-be-prescribed-in-primary-care-policy-guidance/#lidocaine-plasters-updated-2023) states:
    > Lidocaine plasters are licensed for symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster infection (PHN) in adults.
    >
    > NICE guidance on chronic pain does not recommend lidocaine plasters for treating neuropathic pain.
    >
    > The [Specialist Pharmacy Service carried out an evidence review](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/items-which-should-not-be-routinely-prescribed-in-primary-care-evidence-reviews/) on behalf of NHS England to inform the joint clinical working group’s recommendations. Based on this review, lidocaine plasters can be prescribed only for patients who are intolerant of first-line systemic therapies for PHN or where these therapies have been ineffective.
    >
    > Lidocaine plasters are not an alternative to an opioid-based medicine when concerned about dependence and withdrawal.

    NHS England recommend that GPs:

    - Do not initiate.
    - Deprescribe in patients currently prescribed this medicine.
    - Prescribe only if no other item or intervention is clinically appropriate.
    - Prescribe only if no other item or intervention is available.
    - Prescribe only if for a named indication in this guidance.
    
    For guidance on when prescribing may be appropriate in some exceptional circumstances, please see the [full NHS England guidance document](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/items-which-should-not-routinely-be-prescribed-in-primary-care-policy-guidance/#items-where-prescribing-may-be-appropriate-in-some-exceptional-circumstances).
