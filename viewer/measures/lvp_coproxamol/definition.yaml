    [NHS England guidance](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/items-which-should-not-routinely-be-prescribed-in-primary-care-policy-guidance/) identifies a number of items which provide low value when prescribed. This guidance has mainly been aimed at primary care but we think it is important to also monitor a selection of these in hospitals - read more about why [in our blog](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2025/04/low-value-medicines-in-openprescribing-hospitals/).

    [NHS England guidance](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/items-which-should-not-routinely-be-prescribed-in-primary-care-policy-guidance/#co-proxamol-updated-2023) states:
    > The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) fully withdrew the painkiller co-proxamol from the UK market in 2007 due to safety concerns. All use in the UK is now on an unlicensed basis. Prescribing an unlicensed medicine should be in line with General Medical Council (GMC) guidance, which states suitably licensed alternatives need to be considered and the prescriber must be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence or experience of using the medicine to demonstrate its safety and efficacy.
    >
    > Since 1985 advice aimed at the reduction of co-proxamol toxicity and fatal overdose has been provided, but this was not effective and resulted in withdrawal of co-proxamol by the MHRA. In 2011 MHRA reported that the withdrawal of co-proxamol from the UK had saved an estimated 300 to 400 lives each year from self-poisoning, around a fifth of which would have been accidental. Since the withdrawal, further safety concerns have been raised, resulting in co-proxamol being withdrawn in other countries.
    >
    > Due to the significant safety concerns, the joint clinical working group considered co-proxamol suitable for inclusion in this guidance. Co-proxamol is no longer manufactured or supplied in the UK and any use on an unlicensed basis requires it to be imported for individual use, at an increasing cost to the NHS and the environment. 

    NHS England recommend that GPs:

    - Do not initiate.
    - Deprescribe in patients currently prescribed this medicine.
