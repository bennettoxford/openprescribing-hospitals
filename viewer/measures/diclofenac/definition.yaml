description: |
  The percentage of all oral NSAIDs which were issued as diclofenac.

why_it_matters: |
  Oral diclofenac has been associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events compared with some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the [MHRA]([https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/diclofenac-new-contraindications-and-warnings](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/diclofenac-new-contraindications-and-warnings)) emphasise caution in its use and align its safety warnings to be similar to those for selective COX-2 inhibitors. Since safer NSAIDs are available for many indications, a high proportion of diclofenac prescriptions may reflect suboptimal prescribing and expose patients unnecessarily to increased risk. Reducing reliance on diclofenac where clinically appropriate can improve patient safety.

how_is_it_calculated: >
  We divide the number of [Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)](/faq/#what-is-a-defined-daily-dose-ddd) of oral diclofenac products by the total number of DDDs of all oral NSAID products, and then multiply by 100 to obtain a percentage each month.
