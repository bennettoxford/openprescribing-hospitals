why_it_matters: |
    An unlicensed medicine (sometimes called a special or special-order medicine) is a medicine that does not hold a UK marketing authorisation (product licence) from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  

    That means it has not gone through the usual MHRA approval process for safety, quality, and efficacy for its intended use.  

    The MHRA states that prescribers should be satisfied that an alternative, licensed medicine would not meet the patient’s needs before prescribing an unlicensed medicine see,
    [MHRA Off-label or unlicensed use of medicines: prescribers’ responsibilities](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/off-label-or-unlicensed-use-of-medicines-prescribers-responsibilities).

    Licensed formulations of omeprazole liquid began to become available in 2020, and prescribers should consider using these in preference to unlicensed products.

how_is_it_calculated: >
    We identify unlicensed liquid omeprazole products (see <a href="/faq/#how-do-we-identify-if-a-vmp-is-unlicensed" class="underline font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How do we identify if a VMP is unlicensed?</a> for more information).
    
    We then divide the number of [Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)](/faq/#what-is-a-defined-daily-dose-ddd) of unlicensed liquid omeprazole products by the total number of DDDs of all liquid omeprazole products and then multiply by 100 to obtain a percentage each month.
