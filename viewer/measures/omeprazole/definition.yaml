why_it_matters: |
    An unlicensed medicine (sometimes called a special or special-order medicine) is a medicine that does not hold a UK marketing authorisation (product licence) from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  

    That means it has not gone through the usual MHRA approval process for safety, quality, and efficacy for its intended use.  

    The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) states that the use of unlicensed medicines should be limited to occasions where there is no suitable licensed alternative available (see the 
    [ABPI policy position on the use of unlicensed medicines](https://www.abpi.org.uk/media/f01jspbi/policy-position-the-use-of-unlicensed-specials-to-treat-nhs-patients-v2.pdf)).

how_is_it_calculated: >
    We select all omeprazole products with the Virtual Therapeutic Moiety (VTM) code 776991000. 
    We then filter to liquid products by identifying products with the form and route `suspension.oral` or `solution.oral` (excluding those that additionally have the form and route `tablet.oral`, 
    which is the case for  the dispersible gastro-resistant tablets forms of omeprazole).
    The subset of these products that are licensed are specified manually.
    We then divide the monthly [Defined Daily Doses](/faq/#what-is-a-defined-daily-dose-ddd) of unlicensed omeprazole products by the total monthly Defined Daily Doses of all liquid omeprazole products and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
