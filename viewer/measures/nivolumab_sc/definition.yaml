why_it_matters: |
    [Nivolumab](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support/treatments-and-drugs/nivolumab) can be used in the treatment of a range of common cancers. If given intravenously the infusions can take 30-60 minutes. This uses a lot of nursing time and most importantly the patients time. In April 2025 a new formulation of nivolumab designed to be administered as a subcutaneous injection in a fraction of the time [received approval for use in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-authorises-cancer-treatment-variation-with-an-administration-time-of-3-5-minutes).

how_is_it_calculated: |
    We divide the number of products issued of the nivolumab subcutaneous formulation by the total number of products issued of nivolumab. We then multiply that by 100 to obtain the % each month.
