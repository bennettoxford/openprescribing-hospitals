why_it_matters: |
    Nivolumab can be used in the treatment of a range of common cancers. If given intravenously the infusions can take 30-60 minutes. This uses a lot of nursing time and most importantly the patients time. In April 2025 a new formulation of nivolumab designed to be administered as a subcutaneous injection in a fraction of the time received approval for use in the UK. NHS England announced in April 2025 that it would be supporting the introduction of subcutaneous nivolumab. Although not all patients will be eligible, around two in five of those currently receiving intravenous nivolumab are expected to switch to the new subcutaneous injection and most eligible new patients are also expected to begin on the injectable form of nivolumab

how_is_it_calculated: |
    We divide the number of products issued of the nivolumab subcutaneous formulation by the total number of products issued of nivolumab. We then multiply that by 100 to obtain the % each month.
