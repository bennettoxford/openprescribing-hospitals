name: Proportion of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors not prescribed as generic dapagliflozin tablets
short_name: Generic SGLT-2 inhibitors
description: |
  The proportion of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (excluding combination products) not prescribed as generic dapagliflozin 
  tablets. Combination products are excluded as they do not have specified [Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)](/faq/#what-is-a-defined-daily-dose-ddd)
  and the quantity of SGLT-2 inhibitors issued as combinations is low.

  There is an equivalent measure on [OpenPrescribing](https://openprescribing.net/measure/dapagliflozin/) for primary care.
why_it_matters: |
    Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor commonly prescribed in type 2 diabetes, the 
    treatment of chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.

    Dapagliflozin lost its patent in August 2025. From September 2025 the NHS tariff price is likely to fall, as it will
    be [based on the generic price](https://cpe.org.uk/our-news/dapagliflozin-tablets-changes-to-reimbursement-from-september-2025/), 
    rather than the branded product. [NICE guidance on the treatment of diabetes states that](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng28/chapter/Recommendations#drug-treatment) 
    if 2 drugs in the same class are appropriate, choose the option with the lowest acquisition cost. Dapagliflozin is 
    likely to have cost-saving opportunities when compared with other SGLT-2s.
how_is_it_calculated: >
    We identify all SGLT-2 inhibitor products using Virtual Therapeutic Moieties (VTM) codes. The quantity of each product issued as DDDs is calculated. We then divide the
    DDDs of SGLT-2 inhibtors excluding dapagliflozin by the total DDDs of all SGLT-2 inhibitors and then multiply that by 100 to obtain a percentage each month.
